# Harmonic Braider

A simple mathematical sandbox enabling harmonic frequencies to morph into 3D braids  
(Tkinter + Matplotlib GUI).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/harmonic-braider.git
cd harmonic-braider
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Usage

python harmonic.py
Drag the sliders to explore:

H1 (Harmonic 1): number of base loops

H2 (Harmonic 2): braiding wraps

H3 (Harmonic 3): sub-harmonic ripples

B and S: their amplitudes

Twist Factor: MÃ¶bius twist rate

Quat X/Y/Z: 3D rotation

Zoom: scale the view

## Requirements

numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0

tkinter is included with most Python installs; on Linux you may need:
python3-tk
